Long long ago, there was a mountain in the very north, but life there was miserable since there were a lot of monsters and poisonous snakes. However, a hero called Kua fu would always fight with the monsters and snakes for the people of his tribe. And one day, the sun was very close to the ground and killed nearly all the crops. Rivers also dried up because of the sun. Therefore, Kuafu decided to catch the sun and save his tribe. He chased after the sun all the way. Feeling thirsty, he went up to drink the water from the Yellow River and Weishui, which was still not enough for him. Then he tried to go north and drink the water from the Great Lakes. Unfortunately, he died before reaching the lake because of the thirst. Kuafu had a cane, and his cane became a peach forest in the end.
Hearing of the tale, a man by the name of Jian Yang wanted to visit the peach
trees in the Deng Forest. Jian Yang was careful not to greatly overestimate
himself. He carefuly trained for his journey long and hard and eventually
was able to make it to the peach tree forest in the end.
At the peach tree he found the grave of Kua fu. In memoriam he planted his own peach tree to add to the forest. Afterwards, he couldn't help wonder two things. Who has been taking care of this peach tree forest this entire time?
